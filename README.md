# Needleman Wunsch Algorithm Implementation in Python
CS599 graduate course Homework 3:
- Implementation of the Needleman Wunsch algorithm in python.
- Problem #1: Implement Needleman-Wunsch algorithm
A.	Implement a function python that would implement the Needleman-Wunsch alignment between two genomic sequences.
a.	The function must take a genomic similarity scoring matrix and gap penalty as an input.
b.	The function must return:
i.	score for best alignment
ii.	alignment in text format (struct if implemented in C, list of lists or other object if implemented in python).  See below.
